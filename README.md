Command line argument parsing while your sleeping!

## what is Cookie?
Cookie is a simple command line argument parser for Python 3. It uses
decorators to parse arguments while your sleeping! The main focus of Cookie
is to make command line applications without having to change your code
to sute such a task. Just put a Cookie over a function and you're off!

## documentation
The [documentation](https://github.com/PyDever/python-argument-parser/blob/master/docs/README.md) covers installation options and example usage.
