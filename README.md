Command line argument parsing while your sleeping!

## what is Cookie?
Cookie is a simple command line argument parser for Python 3. It uses
decorators to parse arguments while your sleeping! The main focus of Cookie
is to allow you to ***easily*** convert python projects into contained and scalable 
command line applications in **seconds**.

## documentation
The [documentation](https://github.com/PyDever/python-argument-parser/blob/master/docs/README.md) covers installation options and example usage.
